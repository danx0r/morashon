{Annai}
About time.

{Thisone}
Sorry.
I've been pacing around like a madman | trying to figure things out.

{Annai}
Still want to go through with it?

{Thisone}
More than ever.
That fucker is insane.
I think he's in love with you.

{Annai}
That makes him insane?

{Thisone}
No | they're orthogonal statements.
You know what I mean.
If he's actually a he | why does he tell everyone he's an A I?
If he's really A I | how can he be in love with you?

{Annai}
I don't think he's in love with me.
That's ridiculous.

{Thisone}
Why do you say that?

{Annai}
What's to love?
I'm just another grid chick.

{Thisone}
and I'm just another horny coder dude looking for gridsex.

{Annai}
Right.
We're just stereotypes in someone's crappy vid flick.

{Thisone}
So life has no meaning?

{Annai}
I didn't say that.
Sometimes my life feels meaningless.
Other times not.
I thought More eh shun meant something.
Apparently he's just another crappy guy.

{Thisone}
Trying to sell us bogus happy?

{Annai}
He said it | not me.

{Thisone}
His music sort of grows on you.

{Annai}
Yeah.
Like a cancer.

{Thisone}
I have all the gear.
Tested it out today.

{Annai}
Right.
I think we're ready.

{Thisone}
tomorrow night?
He's been tagged you know | the audience will be orders of mag bigger than ever.

{Annai}
Well it's not like we're actually performing.
Not like in the old days.
We're just managing some data in real time.

{Thisone}
I know | I know.
I'm still nervous | even if it is just glorified DJ ing.
We'll have to react to anything unexpected.

{Annai}
If that happens | I'll just pull the plug.

{Thisone}
Leave More eh shun holding the bag?

{Annai}
Serves him right.
I can't wait to see his face after the show.

{Thisone}
Ok.
I guess that's it then.
Break a leg.

{Annai}
What?

{Thisone}
It's an old saying.
Means good luck.

{Annai}
That's fucked up.

{Thisone}
See you on stage I guess.

{Annai}
Yup.
With such a big crowd | we won't be missed.

{Thisone}
then we slip in after our song.

{Annai}
sounds like a plan.
Bye lover.
