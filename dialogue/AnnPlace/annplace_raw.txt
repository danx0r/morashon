_Annai: About time.

_Thisone: Sorry.  I've been pacing around like a madman, trying to figure things out.

_Annai: Still want to go through with it?

_Thisone: More than ever.  That fucker is insane.  I think he's in love with you.

_Annai: That makes him insane?

_Thisone: No, they're orthogonal statements.  
You know what I mean.  
If he's actually a he, why does he tell everyone he's an A I?  
If he's really A I, how can he be in love with you?

_Annai: I don't think he's in love with me.  That's ridiculous.

_Thisone: Why do you say that?

_Annai: What's to love?  I'm just another grid chick.

(pause)

_Thisone: and I'm just another horny coder dude looking for gridsex.

_Annai: Right.  We're just stereotypes in someone's crappy vid flick.

_Thisone: So life has no meaning?

_Annai: I didn't say that.  Sometimes my life feels meaningless.  Other times not.  I thought Morashon meant something.  Apparently he's just another crappy guy.

_Thisone: Trying to sell us bogus happy?

_Annai: He said it, not me.

_Thisone: His music sort of grows on you.

_Annai: Yeah.  Like a cancer.

_Thisone: I have all the gear.  Tested it out today.

_Annai: Right.  I think we're ready.

_Thisone: tomorrow night?  He's been tagged you know, the audience will be orders of mag bigger than ever.

_Annai: Well it's not like we're actually performing.  Not like in the old days.  We're just managing some data in real time.

_Thisone: (pacing) I know, I know.  I'm still nervous, even if it is just glorified DJ-ing.  We'll have to react to anything unexpected.

_Annai: If that happens, I'll just pull the plug.

_Thisone: Leave Morashon holding the bag?

_Annai: Serves him right.  I can't wait to see his face after the show.

_Thisone: Ok.  I guess that's it then.  Break a leg.

_Annai: What?

_Thisone: It's an old saying.  Means good luck.

_Annai: That's fucked up.

_Thisone: See you on stage I guess.

_Annai: Yup.  With such a big crowd, we won't be missed.

_Thisone: then we slip in after our song.

_Annai: sounds like a plan.  Bye lover.
