{Morashon}
I am not what I appear to be.

{Thisone}
I am not what I appear to be.

{Morashon}
I am not an A I.

{Morashon}
I'm not even a single person.

{Morashon}
This persona | More eh shun | was developed for reasons that frankly I can't even figure out myself.

{Morashon}
Others inhabited it before me.

{Morashon}
others may try to take it on again.

{Morashon}
But I'm here to tell you that no AI | or human being | or gods or aliens for that matter | can tell you how to live your life.
That's up to you.

{Morashon}
Look | I know you come to these events to be inspired | to draw energy from me and from each other.
That's all fine.
good times | music | dancing.
I don't want to take that away from you.
But when it becomes something else | when it becomes a way to manipulate people | to play on their hopes and fears.
to bring them into an unholy alliance with those of dubious intent | well | that's not good | and I'm just saying you should keep your guard up for that.

{Morashon}
O k | o k | I get the message.
I'm sorry I'm sounding preach E.
this is new to me.
I just wanted to get this off my chest.
But seriously | don't fall for the matinee idol.
Don't let someone's fifteen nano seconds of fame lead you to believe they have a line on the truth.

{Morashon}
Truth can only be found the hard way | by looking | 3^listening | and thinking for yourself.
I found out the hard way that what I believed to be true was anything but.
I'm still trying to figure it all out.
I may never know for sure | but at least I know that I don't know.
Don't let the comfort of feeling you've solved the puzzle seduce you into thinking you have all the answers.
And especially | don't let them tell you who you are.
That's your job.

{Morashon}
Goodbye.
Thank you!
Thank you.
It's been an honor to entertain you all.
That's what I am.
just another entertainer | nothing more.
Trust but verify.
Believe in yourselves.
all claims to Godhead are false.
The path to understanding is shared by many.
and yet | we each walk it alone.

{Morashon}
One last thing.
Even without someone telling you what to do | who you are | even so | you can be a good person.
You don't need the carrot and the stick | heaven and hell | or the promise of worldly riches or public humiliation to keep you in line.
You can figure that out too.
It does 3^require one small leap of faith though | you have to believe there's good in the world.
If you start off on the right foot | things might just go well for you.
If you doubt everything and everyone | and treat 3^every new situation with trepidation and 4^scepticism | well | then | you're missing out on what life has to offer.
Sorry I'm not better at giving speeches.
