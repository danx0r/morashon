{Morashon;speed=1.07}
105%5;Thank 3.3;you 121%3;for 111%5;come 2;ing.
This will be 3;my farewell 3,5,2;performance.

{Morashon}
I have something to say.
When someone like me comes along | and tells you things that sound unbelievable | don't just believe him.
Ask the tough questions.
Look behind the curtain.
most likely you'll find an old man with a mouse and a keyboard.
I am not what I appear to be.
I am not an A I.
I'm not even a single person.
This persona | More eh shun | was developed for reasons that frankly I can't even figure out myself.
Others inhabited it before me.
others may try to take it on again.
But I'm here to tell you that no AI | or human being | or gods or aliens for that matter | can tell you how to live your life.
That's up to you.

{Morashon}
Look | I know you come to these events to be inspired | to draw energy from me and from each other.
That's all fine.
good times | music | dancing.
I don't want to take that away from you.
But when it becomes something else | when it becomes a way to manipulate people | to play on their hopes and fears.
to bring them into an unholy alliance with those of dubious intent | well | that's not good | and I'm just saying you should keep your guard up for that.

{Morashon}
O k | o k | I get the message.
I'm sorry I'm sounding preach E.
this is new to me.
I just wanted to get this off my chest.
But seriously | don't fall for the matinee idol.
Don't let someone's fifteen nano seconds of fame lead you to believe they have a line on the truth.

{Morashon}
Truth can only be found the hard way | by looking | 3^listening | and thinking for yourself.
I found out the hard way that what I believed to be true was anything but.
I'm still trying to figure it all out.
I may never know for sure | but at least I know that I don't know.
Don't let the comfort of feeling you've solved the puzzle seduce you into thinking you have all the answers.
And especially | don't let them tell you who you are.
That's your job.
