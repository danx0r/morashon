{Annai}
Do you drink for real?

{Thisone}
Just water or juice. I can't take alcohol.

{Annai}
You left without saying goodbye.

{Thisone}
That was creepy. More eh shun is some sort of scam.

{Annai}
Heh. I wish it were that simple.
||||

{Thisone}
What was that song about?
 What was he taking from you and the rest?

{Annai}
It's just expression. We live in a fantasy world | why shouldn't we indulge in imagination?

{Thisone}
But there was significance in what he was saying | as well as the images. Do you listen to the lyrics?

{Annai}
Of course I listen to the lyrics. I listen to everything. I breathe it in. Doesn't it move you?

{Thisone}
It scares me | a bit. Music and lyrics like that have to be... alive. Even if software could think | it wouldn't come up with anything like that.

{Annai}
How do you know what software would or wouldn't do?
 Just because you code | doesn't mean you know squat about your code. Any real coder knows that.

{Thisone}
I've heard all the arguments || going back to Dennett | refuting Searle | etcetera and so on. 
Code writes code | data is code. 
Evolution works its magic | explicitly or implicitly. 
Complexity leads to emergence. 

{Thisone}
But it's all theoretical. 
There's never been any evidence that it could really exist. 
Even though the grid has been on line for thirty plus years | running peta flops of simulated evolution per second.
The most I've heard of getting out of the lab is somewhere between a rat and a highly autistic savant.

{Annai}
So you still think it's a bunch of Finnish jokers with some new body gear.

{Thisone}
As a 4^rationalist | that's a much better hypothesis than buying this A I crap.

{Annai}
Have you ever known Finns to be that creepy | as you say?

{Thisone}
definitely.

{Annai}
You're just prejudiced against Finland. They invented the grid | and everyone else is still jealous.
||||

{Annai}
I might be Finnish | you know. Apologize to Finland.

{Thisone}
Ok | I apologize. To Finland. Can we move on now?

{Annai}
Where are you from | anyway?

{Thisone}
in real life?

{Annai}
(smiles) yes | your other life. Outside.

{Thisone}
Let's just say I'm not from Finland.

{Annai}
I guessed as much. I suppose it doesn't matter anymore | unless you're silly enough to care about time zones.

{Thisone}
I'm not.

{Annai}
Me either.

{Thisone}
I'm on line most of the time I'm awake at this point. I jack out and sleep when I'm tired. Real life doesn't have much left for me. I think I'd call it quits if the grid ever went down.

{Annai}
What do you mean | went down?

{Thisone}
The grid.
This ||| are virtual world.
It's based on real life infrastructure. 
Never forget that. I'm old enough to remember hardware failure.

{Annai}
I've never heard anyone even consider something like that before.

{Thisone}
Well there's tons of redundancy | and it's hyper-distributed | so -- the chances are certainly remote. Asteroid | nuclear explosion | that sort of thing.

{Annai}
Well I don't think I could handle it.

{Thisone}
We've still got our bodies | we keep them alive. I hope you're running Twitch -- gotta keep those muscles toned.

{Annai}
(looking distracted) Sure.

{Thisone}
I'm sorry | I don't know your situation. Maybe you're sick | or on life support or something.

{Annai}
No | no. Nothing like that. I just like it here. I don't have much life outside.

{Thisone}
Well | same here. The jet-bloggers go on about it | right?
 Bragging about their brief bike rides topside | with all that life support gear -- sounds like a chore | and an unnecessary risk.

{Annai}
I bike. Well | you know | here. For exercise. It's healthier than just relying on Twitch.

{Thisone}
Sure. We should bike sometimes. I know a great trail | it's in Germondo.

{Annai}
Sure. Some day.

{Thisone}
You don't sound sure.

{Annai}
Sure of what?

{Thisone}
You don't sound like you really want to go biking.

{Annai}
Well it's all bullshit | as you say.

{Thisone}
I never said that.

{Annai}
No | but I can tell. It's your attitude.

{Thisone}
What attitude?

{Annai}
Nevermind.
||||

{Thisone}
What did you mean just now?
 You think I sound old | right?

{Annai}
(cocks head) Well | I think it's obvious you're older than me.

{Thisone}
How can you tell?

{Annai}
Your take on the Grid | for one. Scepticism about More eh shun. Just the whole 'tude. It's pre-grid.

{Thisone}
I'm not pre-grid. I'm not that old.

{Annai}
No | I don't mean biologically | that you're literally older than the grid. That would be old. I just mean | it's not everything to you. You still think about real life | topside.

{Thisone}
real life and Topside are two very different things.

{Annai}
Exactly.

(pause)

{Thisone}
Oh | I get it. Since we fucked up topside | and real life is just our little cubbies | and only the mega-rich can go anywhere for real...

{Annai}
Exactly.

{Thisone}
For your generation | real life | topside | anything but the Grid is just -- irrelevant.

{Annai}
Ok. Sort of. Not totally irrelevant.

 Just -- obsolete. Offline.

{Thisone}
Offline | heh. I get it.

{Annai}
maybe you do | but you've still got that meme tucked away -- that we're just here for the short term. It's a fix-up for a problem. One day | topside will be restored | and real life will be meaningful again.

{Thisone}
Don't you believe that?
 If not in our time | then someday.

{Annai}
Hah. You listen to the blogo-heads. The establishment | the folks who run everything. They've got a vested interest in our believing. But we -- I mean | those of us who have little memory of before -- we see it differently.

{Thisone}
For you | this is life. It's everything.

{Annai}
Precisely. And for you | too. You just can't admit it.

{Thisone}
(thinks for a moment) Maybe you're right. Even as the interface gear gets better and better | I never feel like this is home. I'm homesick | I guess.

{Annai}
But this is my home. I never had anything else.

{Thisone}
We're probably only a few years apart. In age | I mean.

{Annai}
It might as well be lightyears.

{Thisone}
Distance is a vec4.

{Annai}
Yes | space and time. Minkowski metric. You know the grid is non-relativistic.

{Thisone}
Not exactly. There's still network lag. They work it into the physics somehow.

{Annai}
You wanna catch More eh shun tonight?

{Thisone}
Not really.

{Annai}
You should give him a chance. He's really changed my life.

{Thisone}
What do you mean | changed your life?

{Annai}
I mean what I say. I was drifting. More eh shun keeps me grounded. The music | the people. We have a special bond.

{Thisone}
Well | I think he's some sort of Svengali.

{Annai}
What? (blank expression as she looks it up) Oh --
 I see. No | it's not like that.

{Thisone}
Jim jones then | or David Koresh.

{Annai}
|||
That's terrible
 He's not like that at all. You think he wants to kill us?

{Thisone}
Maybe not literally. I think he -- or it -- whatever | they | I suspect -- have ulterior motives. || I'll settle for L. Ron Hubbard.

{Annai}
|||
He sounds like a character.

{Thisone}
I hear he was.

{Annai}
Founded his own nation at sea.

{Thisone}
Chained people to desks for minor infractions. Swindled millions out of their life savings | separated them from their families.

{Annai}
Well | I don't think that More eh shun has any plans like that. Plus | his music is good. Hubbard's writing was terrible | apparently.

{Thisone}
Yeah | he didn't cut it as an artist. But he was a pretty good cult leader.

{Annai}
Do you see the good in anyone?
 Or are you always on the defensive?

{Thisone}
I see good in you.

{Annai}
|||
Thanks. That was nice.

{Thisone}
I can be nice. Even if I'm old.

{Annai}
I'm sorry | I didn't mean to be ageist.

{Thisone}
Whatever. All is forgiven.

{Annai}
(almost singing) All will be revealed...

{Thisone}
oh. Him again.

{Annai}
You should talk to him someday. He's brilliant. It's not just the music. He has ideas that will change the world.

{Thisone}
You mean change the Grid.

{Annai}
Same thing. He could have an impact. Everything is so fractured now.

{Thisone}
You mean he's planning to go grid-wide?

{Annai}
Well it's all viral of course. His stats are growing slowly but steadily. He's not in a hurry.
||||

{Annai}
He's running multiples | you know. It's not just our little group.

{Thisone}
So when we hang out with him | each time it's a different team of Finnish mind-fuckers?

{Annai}
(annoyed) Whatever | as the ancients used to say.

{Thisone}
That stings.

{Annai}
Sorry. I just wish you would give him a chance.

{Thisone}
If it makes you happy | I'll come to another concert. A big one | like the first though. I don't want to sit around in that creepy room.

{Annai}
Ok. (shoots url) Be there or be square.

{Thisone}
Talk about ancient!

{Annai}
If it's old enough | it's cool.
