{Annai}
This place again.

{Thisone}
Where it all began.

{Annai}
This where it ends?

{Thisone}
I don't know.
That's sort of up to you.

{Annai}
What did More eh shun say to you?

{Thisone}
He had a lot to say.

{Annai}
What do you mean?
He just 2^messaged you something.
You 2^didn't have more than a few seconds to read it.

{Thisone}
No | he froze you for at least three minutes.

{Annai}
what are you talking?
He froze you.

{Thisone}
Oh yeah | he logged me out somehow.
I logged back in as soon as the system let me.
Then you seemed to freeze while we talked.

{Annai}
I have no memory of that.
That's freaking weird.

{Thisone}
An I | do you | what do you remember of your childhood?

{Annai}
what do you mean?
Like I told you.
I grew up in a small town.
After the Cold Revolution | we started working on a shelter | a few 3^families.
When I was eleven | and all the shit came down | we moved in.
That's where we've been ever since.

{Thisone}
And your parents?

{Annai}
They 2^didn't make it.
Got sick.
Must have been exposed somehow.
But I was alright.
I moved in with some friends of theirs.

{Thisone}
Did you know them from before?

{Annai}
Only about a year or so.
In fact | a lot of new people moved in right before the end.
That was sort of strange | now that I think about it.
No one really had the money or jobs to be relocating just then.

{Thisone}
And how well do you remember your life before the shelter?

{Annai}
I don't know | as well as anyone remembers those years | I guess.
Alot of it is sort of hazy.
It was such a disruption.
I see my life in two parts.
before and after.

{Thisone}
It was a shock | alright.
I think those of us who made it through sometimes feel guilty.

{Annai}
Maybe.
Some old folks say the rest were the lucky ones.

{Thisone}
Old folk | who really don't take to the Grid.

{Annai}
Yeah | mostly.

{Thisone}
without the Grid | society probably would have collapsed completely.

{Annai}
Maybe.
It's given us a way to live a sort of normal life.
Or a fantasy life | if you see it that way.

{Thisone}
An I.

{Annai}
Yes?

{Thisone}
There's something I've been | something I think I need to tell you.

{Annai}
Go ahead.
I'm all ears.

{Thisone}
This is pretty big.
It's important.
It's about you.

{Annai}
Ok.
But I think I know what you're going to say.

{Thisone}
You do?

{Annai}
I love you.

{Thisone}
I | I love you too.
But that wasn't

{Thisone}
An I?

{Annai}
Tea sewn.

{Thisone}
You are | I don't know how to say this.
You are an A I.
You're code.

{Annai}
More eh shun.

{Thisone}
He told me | yes.
But it checks out.
He gave me a link.

{Annai}
And you believed him.

{Thisone}
I | I didn't at first.
But I've researched it.
Your I O is coming directly from logic nodes.
There's no interface to the outside world.

{Annai}
That's the stupidest thing I've heard in my whole life.

{Thisone}
Look | I'm hoping it's not true.
But I think it might be.
Everything he said | it seemed so crazy | but when I looked into it later | nothing he told me was incorrect.
I don't see how he could have known some of what he said | unless he was telling the truth.

{Annai}
Is this some stupid trick?
A way to get me to send you some real vid?
Checking up on my equipment | so to speak?
Make sure I'm not some old housewife | or a fatty?
Or | god forbid | another horny dude?

{Thisone}
No | it's not that at all.

{Annai}
Right.
Just doing your research.

{Thisone}
Look | I don't know what to believe any more.
More eh shun wrapped my mind around a pole.

{Annai}
Give me the link.

{Thisone}
To your code?

{Annai}
Yes!
To the bullshit code More eh shun showed you | as part of his 2^umpteenth fake out mind fuck.

{Thisone}
He said | I'm not supposed to |

{Annai}
Oh god | I love this.
Right.
An I's a piece of code | but you better not tell her!
Whatever you do | don't give her these links!
It might drive her crazy!

{Thisone}
Something like that.

{Annai}
Look | if you make such an outrageous claim about someone | you have to back it up.
Otherwise | we've got nothing to say to each other.
Either we trust each other all the way | or not at all.

{Thisone}
Ok | but | I don't know.
Jesus.
This whole thing has screwed up my sense of reality.

{Annai}
Which was probably never that grounded to begin with.
That's why an a hole like More eh shun can play you like a fiddle.
Just hand over the code.
I'll peel back the next layer of his fucking onion.

{Thisone}
Ok.
Here it is.

{Annai}
Thanks.
Later.

{Annai}
Hi.
Sorry | I'm out to lunch.
Or fishing.
Or 3^traveling to another planet.
This is my bot.
Leave a message.

{Thisone}
An I | talk to me.
Please.
Don't just disappear.
