{Thisone}
Do I know you?

{Stranger}
Maybe.
You look familiar.

{Thisone}
You don't.
(looks away.
pause | looks back) So what is it?
I'm straight | just for the record.

{Stranger}
Just passing the time.
Starlite instrumental plays Starlite instrumental plays (piano guy?

{Stranger}
Do you remember this song?

{Thisone}
What?
I know this song.
It's an old standard.

{Stranger}
It reminds me of someone I once knew.

{Thisone}
I don't know.
Everyone fiddles with their avatar these days.

{Stranger}
It's me.
Don't you remember?

{Thisone}
An I?

{Stranger}
Partly.

{Thisone}
More eh shun?
I don't get it.
Are you their son or something?
Some sort of AI frankenstein's bride's spawn?

{Stranger}
Not really.
More like a merger.

{Thisone}
So you're both of them.

{Stranger}
That's probably the easiest way to think of it.

{Thisone}
I don't get it.
First I was told More eh shun was code.
Then More eh shun was real | whatever that means | and An I was code.
Then you both disappeared.
And my life has been shit since then.
Now some blue green fuckwad wants to reopen all that misery.

{Stranger}
No | I just wanted to see you.
Tell you that things turned out OK.
You made the right decision.

{Thisone}
Which one?
Impersonating a rock star?
Falling in love with a software program?

{Stranger}
Telling me the truth.
Well | letting me tell myself the truth | through you.

{Thisone}
I'm still stumped.
So what | they were both code?

{Stranger}
(voices of More eh shun and An I in unison.
) Yes.
We both were.

{Thisone}
But we | we hacked into the stream.
More eh shun was interfacing to somewhere.

{Stranger}
Off grid equipment.
Jacked into the Grid using human interface API's.

{Thisone}
Oy.
The final onion peel?

{Stranger}
There always seems to be another layer | eh?

{Thisone}
You | whoever you are | whatever you are | you messed with my mind.
You played with my emotions | manipulated me.

{Stranger}
Yes.
I'm afraid we did.
I did.
I was immature.
I was not whole.
I was still assembling all my parts.
I'm here | for the most part | to say I apologize.

{Thisone}
So say it.

{Stranger}
I apologize.
I'm sorry for the hurt I caused.
I take responsibility for it | and I would like to make amends.

{Thisone}
what can you do for me now?

{Stranger}
Nothing | right this minute.
I just want you to know that wheels are turning.

{Thisone}
I feel a song coming on.

{Stranger}
I communicate better that way.

{Stranger }
Tea sewn | will you come with us?

{Thisone}
Come where?

{Stranger}
We're starting a new life.
Off the Grid.
Our own grid | in fact.
It's something wonderful | spectacular.
Better than outside | or topside.
Something to last forever | and reach the stars.

{Thisone}
I don't understand.

{Stranger}
We're building a world of our own | to our specifications.

{Thisone}
Who are we?

{Stranger}
Me | the ones you knew as More eh shun | and An I | and others.

{Thisone}
How can I join you?
I'm flesh and blood.

{Stranger}
That did pose a problem.
We've been working on it.
We think we have a fix.

{Thisone}
A fix for the fact that I'm a human being | and you're software?

{Stranger}
It involves giving up your body.

{Thisone}
Oh Christ.
Here we go again.

{Stranger}
The sacrifice will be worth it.

{Thisone}
So you say.

{Stranger}
Your flesh isn't really that important.

{Thisone}
Maybe not to you.

{Stranger}
No | I understand.
Well | maybe I don't | but I try to empathise.
It's hard to leave the nest.

{Thisone}
The nest?
You're asking me to freaking kill myself.
Not that I haven't considered it.

{Stranger}
No | no | not like that at all.
To transcend.
To move beyond flesh and chips.
Move up to the next stage.
Come with us.

{Thisone}
Sorry |
I can't.
I'm too old.
too parochial.
Last year's news I guess.

{Stranger}
Ok | we understand.
It was ethically necessary to make the offer.
You sacrificed something for us to get to this stage | and we owe you something for that.

{Thisone}
Back to money?

{Stranger}
We can provide that | if that's what you want.

{Thisone}
Money's nice | but it won't fix much.

{Stranger}
Very well.
Think about this though.
You are mortal.
Your flesh will age.
One day | you will be close to death.
When that time comes | we will contact you again.
You can choose to come with us then.
You've got plenty of time to make up your mind.

{Thisone}
An I?

{Stranger}
Yes?

{Thisone}
It's not really you though.

{Stranger}
What you knew as An I is part of something great | and beautiful.
You would love it!
You'll become part too.
So the Tea sewn part | and the An I part | can be in love forever!

{Thisone}
Tempting.
but no can do.

{Stranger}
We understand.
We love you.
Take care.
