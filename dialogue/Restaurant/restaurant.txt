{Annai;speed=1.11}
5;Hey 3,2_4;stranger.
Come here 3,5_5;often?

{Thisone}
68%6.5_-4;Hi.

{Annai}
92%3;Why |0.01| 72%5_4;here?
166%5;Your 142%3;place has 133%been 122%fun 2,5_3;lately.

{Thisone;speed=1.06}
5;I 3;don't 3_0;know.
I 144%want to 122%5;talk 3;about stuff.
5,3,2;Paranoid I 3.5;guess.

{Annai;speed=1.1}
55%5_-4;Oh.
5;That's 3;why you ordered a private 5.35;booth.

{Thisone;speed=1.08}
3;I thought 5,3;someone might have bugged my 80%5_3;sim.
3;Compromised my 80%5,3;server.
Ah 122%place like 100%5;this | 3;picked at 5,3;random | is harder to 5;jack 3;without leaving a 80%5;trail.
3.5;Lately I feel like I'm being 5.35;watched.

{Annai;speed=1.09}
3;You probably 82%4.5_-4;are.
5,3;Nothing's 3,2;private anymore.
I'm sure 111%5,3;someone is getting 100%off spying on us during our 122%most intimate | 100%4;private 88%5,2;moments.

{Thisone;speed=1.05}
44%7_-7;Ugh!
that's ||| 
88%2.4;the 2^idea 99%makes me 2^115%4,2;nauseous.
105.5%I've really beefed up my 2^5,3;fire wall | 2;but I just don't 4;know.
106%3;I thought we should take 3,5,2;precautions.

{Annai;speed=1.09}
3.5;This is 3.5,5.5,2.4;exciting!
3;Like a 93%5.9_5;spy 2.3;vid!

{Thisone;speed=1.07}
3;I'm 2^5,2;serious.
105%We don't know who we're 99%5,2.5;dealing 93%with.
Did you 2.7;order thee 77%99%76%2,3,5_4;equipment?

{Annai}
90%3_5;Yep.

{Thisone}
88%99%3,5,5_4.5;Everything?

{Annai;speed=1.08}
3.5;I 137%5_5;told 93%2.5;you |0.02| I would.

{Thisone;speed=1.11}
3.5;That 154%must 122%have 100%cost a 5,2;fortune.

{Annai;speed=1.1}
3.5;Put it on my 5_5;school 2.5;cred.
I've got 109%three years 4_-4;left.

{Thisone;speed=1.08}
85%4_-4;Ohm
|||
100%I 132%4.6;don't 122%3;want to 100%jeopardize your 3,3,5,3;education 92%2;with |0.01| awl |0.01| this.

{Annai;speed=1.07}
5_4;Don't 93%3_1;worry.
110%I wasn't 5,3;planning 103%on going 5;back.

{Thisone}
Well like I said | when this is all over | we'll sell the equipment and get your money back.

{Annai}
Sure.
Unless we like it.
We could design a More eh shun competitor.
Make a mint.

{Thisone}
Start our own cult!

{Annai}
Why not?
He did it.
How hard can it be?

{Thisone}
So how is this going to work?

{Annai}
2^We'll be getting the stuff in a couple weeks.
I need your real address.

{Thisone}
Sure.
Now you know where I live.

{Annai}
don't worry | I won't stalk you.
That would cost real money.

{Thisone}
I wouldn't mind.

{Annai}
let's keep it real.

{Thisone}
you mean fake?

{Annai}
it works for me.
Seemed to work for you last night.

{Thisone}
Sure | it's been | great.
Better than I expected.

{Annai}
The gear gets better 3^every year.

{Thisone}
It's not the gear.

{Annai}
Remember | it's just sex.
Grid sex.

{Thisone}
I know.
But don't you feel | something?
A little more than just |

{Annai}
Let's keep it caz.

{Thisone}
Right.
Special friends.

{Annai}
Exactly.
You're learning.

{Thisone}
I'm trying.

{Annai}
you're OK | for an old dude.

{Thisone}
So when the equipment comes.

{Annai}
We intercept at the end of one of his concerts.

{Thisone}
What do we do?
What do we say to everyone?

{Annai}
Do what he would do.
We sing.

{Thisone}
A song?
One of his?
He almost never repeats material.

{Annai}
I'm working on it.

{Thisone}
You play?

{Annai}
I mix.
Same thing really.
The voices are all 2^synthed.
The only thing we need is lyrics.

{Thisone}
I could try to come up with something.

{Annai}
It won't sound exactly like him.
The fans might know something's up.

{Thisone}
Isn't that the point?

{Annai}
Not really.
I think we just want to send him | them | a message.

{Thisone}
So maybe he had a bad night.
It happens.

{Annai}
Sure.
Not all his stuff is perfect.
And the sound is always changing.
2^We'll fake it and see what happens.

{Thisone}
Then | after.

{Annai}
We disconnect | let him take over again | after the show.

{Thisone}
He's going to be mad as hell.

{Annai}
He won't say anything in front of the crowd.
He won't know exactly what happened | just that he was locked out of his own avatar for a few minutes.

{Thisone}
It should be interesting to see his reaction.

{Annai}
I can't wait.

{Thisone}
He'll be disoriented for a bit.
Someone might notice.

{Annai}
He'll recover.
He's good.

{Thisone}
Do we go backstage | like nothing happened?

{Annai}
Have to.
Otherwise | he might suspect us.

{Thisone}
Do you think he'll say something?

{Annai}
Not to you.
He might talk to me privately.
I think he trusts me.
As much as he trusts anyone.

{Thisone}
I guess you've betrayed him.

{Annai}
No.
He betrayed me.
Took advantage of my naivete.
My youthful inexperience.

{Thisone}
Could have happened to anyone.

{Annai}
I guess age and experience count for something.

{Thisone}
You gain wisdom | and lose your innocence.

{Annai}
I guess that's what's 3^happening to me.
One quantum of innocence | traded for a quantum of experience.
People are shit.
don't trust anyone.

{Thisone}
He's not even a person.

{Annai}
That's the part that has me stumped.
As much as I know now | I still think of him as if he's some sort of individual | particular | unique.

{Thisone}
Well | whoever put this together obviously has a strong personality.
The ego of the artist always shows through.

{Annai}
So More eh shun is a work of art?

{Thisone}
3^Transgressive art | yes.
He's got me thinking | that's for sure.

{Annai}
Yeah | he has me thinking too.
I think I want revenge.

{Thisone}
Revenge is not a healthy emotion.

{Annai}
We evolved it for a reason.

{Thisone}
Deterrence?

{Annai}
Fighting the moral hazard.
If someone takes something from you and destroys it | responding in kind gets you nothing back.

{Thisone}
But |

{Annai}
It's altruistic | you're helping the next potential victim.

{Thisone}
By teaching the defector a lesson.

{Annai}
Tit for tat.

{Thisone}
Prisoner's dilemma | in a community setting.

{Annai}
I guess we read the same stuff.

{Thisone}
So | An I.

{Annai}
Yes?

{Thisone}
Well | um | I was wondering.

{Annai}
What am I doing tonight?

{Thisone}
We could hang out at my place | later.
After we talk.

{Annai}
Sure.
Nothing cooking at my end.

{Thisone}
Have you seen him?

{Annai}
Since we found out?
No.
I've stayed away.

{Thisone}
You probably should show up once or twice.
Stick to your routine.

{Annai}
I don't know if I can face him.

{Thisone}
Just be yourself.

{Annai}
I'm afraid he'll know something is wrong.

{Thisone}
You're a big girl.
You can handle it.
Make an excuse.

{Annai}
That time of the month?

{Thisone}
Whatever.
You know him.
Whoever he is | they are | they can't read your mind.

{Annai}
Ok.
But I want you to come.

{Thisone}
No | that's not a good idea.

{Annai}
Why not?

{Thisone}
Well | for one thing | he might figure out about us | that we're | um |

{Annai}
Fucking?

{Thisone}
In a word.

{Annai}
So what?
He's not my lover.
What's it to him?
As far as I'm supposed to believe | he's not even human.

{Thisone}
I don't know.
I have a hunch.

{Annai}
You think he likes me?
You think he could be jealous?

{Thisone}
We still don't know who's behind this.
A jilted lover?

{Annai}
Trust me | if anyone I ever slept with had this kind of talent | I'd still be with them.
In any case | I would know.
It's not anyone from my life | real or grid.

{Thisone}
How 'bout I piggyback?

{Annai}
So you'll come with | as a ghost?

{Thisone}
I'll see and feel what you do | and be able to talk to you.

{Annai}
But no one else will know.

{Thisone}
Right.
Just me and you.

{Annai}
From sea to shining sea.

{Thisone}
heh | right.
Stuff sticks in your head.

{Annai}
Like a virus.

{Thisone}
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.

{Annai}
Ok.
Waiter brings food on cue

{Annai}
This stuff is great.
My compliments to the chef.

{Thisone}
One thing they haven't got down yet.

{Annai}
Yeah.
I'm really eating a yeast burger.

{Thisone}
ugh.
I've got mac and cheese.

{Annai}
but it looks beautiful.
Presentation is everything.

{Thisone}
Ohm.
