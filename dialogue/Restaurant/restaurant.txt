{Annai}
Hey stranger.
Come here often?

{Thisone}
Hey.

{Annai}
Why here?
Your place has been fun lately.

{Thisone}
I dunno.
I want to talk about stuff.
Paranoid I guess.

{Annai}
Oh.
That's why you ordered a private booth.

{Thisone}
I thought someone might have bugged my sim.
Compromised my server.
A place like this | picked at random | is harder to jack without leaving a trail.
Lately I feel like I'm being watched.

{Annai}
You probably are.
Nothing's private anymore.
I'm sure someone is getting off spying on us during our most intimate | private moments.

{Thisone}
Ugh!
that's | the idea makes me nauseous.
I've really beefed up my 2^fire wall | but I just don't know.
I thought we should take precautions.

{Annai}
This is exciting!
Like a spy vid!

{Thisone}
I'm serious.
We don't know who we're dealing with.
Did you order the equipment?

{Annai}
Yep.

{Thisone}
Everything?

{Annai}
I told you I would.

{Thisone}
That must have cost a fortune.

{Annai}
Put it on my school cred.
I've got three years left.

{Thisone}
Awk | I don't want to jeopardize your education with all this.

{Annai}
Don't worry.
I wasn't planning on going back.

{Thisone}
Well like I said | when this is all over | we'll sell the equipment and get your money back.

{Annai}
Sure.
Unless we like it.
We could design a More eh shun competitor.
Make a mint.

{Thisone}
Start our own cult!

{Annai}
Why not?
He did it.
How hard can it be?

{Thisone}
So how is this going to work?

{Annai}
2^We'll be getting the stuff in a couple weeks.
I need your real address.

{Thisone}
Sure.
Now you know where I live.

{Annai}
don't worry | I won't stalk you.
That would cost real money.

{Thisone}
I wouldn't mind.

{Annai}
let's keep it real.

{Thisone}
you mean fake?

{Annai}
it works for me.
Seemed to work for you last night.

{Thisone}
Sure | it's been | great.
Better than I expected.

{Annai}
The gear gets better 3^every year.

{Thisone}
It's not the gear.

{Annai}
Remember | it's just sex.
Grid sex.

{Thisone}
I know.
But don't you feel | something?
A little more than just |

{Annai}
Let's keep it caz.

{Thisone}
Right.
Special friends.

{Annai}
Exactly.
You're learning.

{Thisone}
I'm trying.

{Annai}
you're OK | for an old dude.

{Thisone}
So when the equipment comes.

{Annai}
We intercept at the end of one of his concerts.

{Thisone}
What do we do?
What do we say to everyone?

{Annai}
Do what he would do.
We sing.

{Thisone}
A song?
One of his?
He almost never repeats material.

{Annai}
I'm working on it.

{Thisone}
You play?

{Annai}
I mix.
Same thing really.
The voices are all 2^synthed.
The only thing we need is lyrics.

{Thisone}
I could try to come up with something.

{Annai}
It won't sound exactly like him.
The fans might know something's up.

{Thisone}
Isn't that the point?

{Annai}
Not really.
I think we just want to send him | them | a message.

{Thisone}
So maybe he had a bad night.
It happens.

{Annai}
Sure.
Not all his stuff is perfect.
And the sound is always changing.
2^We'll fake it and see what happens.

{Thisone}
Then | after.

{Annai}
We disconnect | let him take over again | after the show.

{Thisone}
He's going to be mad as hell.

{Annai}
He won't say anything in front of the crowd.
He won't know exactly what happened | just that he was locked out of his own avatar for a few minutes.

{Thisone}
It should be interesting to see his reaction.

{Annai}
I can't wait.

{Thisone}
He'll be disoriented for a bit.
Someone might notice.

{Annai}
He'll recover.
He's good.

{Thisone}
Do we go backstage | like nothing happened?

{Annai}
Have to.
Otherwise | he might suspect us.

{Thisone}
Do you think he'll say something?

{Annai}
Not to you.
He might talk to me privately.
I think he trusts me.
As much as he trusts anyone.

{Thisone}
I guess you've betrayed him.

{Annai}
No.
He betrayed me.
Took advantage of my naivete.
My youthful inexperience.

{Thisone}
Could have happened to anyone.

{Annai}
I guess age and experience count for something.

{Thisone}
You gain wisdom | and lose your innocence.

{Annai}
I guess that's what's 3^happening to me.
One quantum of innocence | traded for a quantum of experience.
People are shit.
don't trust anyone.

{Thisone}
He's not even a person.

{Annai}
That's the part that has me stumped.
As much as I know now | I still think of him as if he's some sort of individual | particular | unique.

{Thisone}
Well | whoever put this together obviously has a strong personality.
The ego of the artist always shows through.

{Annai}
So More eh shun is a work of art?

{Thisone}
3^Transgressive art | yes.
He's got me thinking | that's for sure.

{Annai}
Yeah | he has me thinking too.
I think I want revenge.

{Thisone}
Revenge is not a healthy emotion.

{Annai}
We evolved it for a reason.

{Thisone}
Deterrence?

{Annai}
Fighting the moral hazard.
If someone takes something from you and destroys it | responding in kind gets you nothing back.

{Thisone}
But |

{Annai}
It's altruistic | you're helping the next potential victim.

{Thisone}
By teaching the defector a lesson.

{Annai}
Tit for tat.

{Thisone}
Prisoner's dilemma | in a community setting.

{Annai}
I guess we read the same stuff.

{Thisone}
So | An I.

{Annai}
Yes?

{Thisone}
Well | um | I was wondering.

{Annai}
What am I doing tonight?

{Thisone}
We could hang out at my place | later.
After we talk.

{Annai}
Sure.
Nothing cooking at my end.

{Thisone}
Have you seen him?

{Annai}
Since we found out?
No.
I've stayed away.

{Thisone}
You probably should show up once or twice.
Stick to your routine.

{Annai}
I don't know if I can face him.

{Thisone}
Just be yourself.

{Annai}
I'm afraid he'll know something is wrong.

{Thisone}
You're a big girl.
You can handle it.
Make an excuse.

{Annai}
That time of the month?

{Thisone}
Whatever.
You know him.
Whoever he is | they are | they can't read your mind.

{Annai}
Ok.
But I want you to come.

{Thisone}
No | that's not a good idea.

{Annai}
Why not?

{Thisone}
Well | for one thing | he might figure out about us | that we're | um |

{Annai}
Fucking?

{Thisone}
In a word.

{Annai}
So what?
He's not my lover.
What's it to him?
As far as I'm supposed to believe | he's not even human.

{Thisone}
I don't know.
I have a hunch.

{Annai}
You think he likes me?
You think he could be jealous?

{Thisone}
We still don't know who's behind this.
A jilted lover?

{Annai}
Trust me | if anyone I ever slept with had this kind of talent | I'd still be with them.
In any case | I would know.
It's not anyone from my life | real or grid.

{Thisone}
How 'bout I piggyback?

{Annai}
So you'll come with | as a ghost?

{Thisone}
I'll see and feel what you do | and be able to talk to you.

{Annai}
But no one else will know.

{Thisone}
Right.
Just me and you.

{Annai}
From sea to shining sea.

{Thisone}
heh | right.
Stuff sticks in your head.

{Annai}
Like a virus.

{Thisone}
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.

{Annai}
Ok.
Waiter brings food on cue

{Annai}
This stuff is great.
My compliments to the chef.

{Thisone}
One thing they haven't got down yet.

{Annai}
Yeah.
I'm really eating a yeast burger.

{Thisone}
ugh.
I've got mac and cheese.

{Annai}
but it looks beautiful.
Presentation is everything.

{Thisone}
Ohm.
