_Annai: Hey stranger.  Come here often?

_Thisone: Hey. (After a little hesitation, he pecks her on the cheek)

_Annai: Why here?  Your place has been fun lately.

_Thisone: I dunno.  I want to talk about stuff.  Paranoid I guess.

_Annai: Oh.  That's why you ordered a private booth.

_Thisone: I thought someone might have bugged my sim.  Compromised my server.  A place like this, picked at random, is harder to jack without leaving a trail.  Lately I feel like I'm being watched.

_Annai: You probably are.  Nothing's private anymore.  I'm sure someone is getting off spying on us during our most intimate, private moments. (she puts a hand on his thigh)

_Thisone: (shudders) Ugh!  that's -- the idea makes me nauseous.  I've really beefed up my firewall, but I just don't know.  I thought we should take precautions.

_Annai: This is exciting! Like a spy vid!

_Thisone: I'm serious.  We don't know who we're dealing with. (pause) Did you order the equipment?

_Annai: Yep.

_Thisone: Everything?

_Annai: I told you I would.

_Thisone: That must have cost a fortune.

_Annai: Put it on my school cred.  I've got three years left.

_Thisone: Awk, I don't want to jeopardize your education with all this.

_Annai: Don't worry.  I wasn't planning on going back.

_Thisone: Well like I said, when this is all over, we'll sell the equipment and get your money back.

_Annai: Sure.  Unless we like it.  We could design a Morashon competitor.  Make a mint.

_Thisone: Start our own cult!

_Annai: Why not?  He did it.  How hard can it be?

_Thisone: So how is this going to work?

_Annai: We'll be getting the stuff in a couple weeks.  I need your real address.

_Thisone: Sure. (sends it).  Now you know where I live.

_Annai: don't worry, I won't stalk you.  That would cost real money.

_Thisone: I wouldn't mind.

_Annai: let's keep it "real".

_Thisone: you mean fake?

_Annai: it works for me.  Seemed to work for you last night.

_Thisone: (embarrassed) Sure, it's been -- great.  Better than I expected.

_Annai: the gear gets better every year.

_Thisone: It's not the gear.

_Annai: (a little flustered) remember, it's just sex.  Gridsex.

_Thisone: I know.  But don't you feel -- something?  A little more than just --

_Annai: Let's keep it caz.

_Thisone: Right.  Special friends.

_Annai:  Exactly.  You're learning.

_Thisone: I'm trying.

_Annai: you're OK, for an old dude.

(silence)

_Thisone: So when the equipment comes...

_Annai: We intercept at the end of one of his concerts.

_Thisone: What do we do?  What do we say to everyone?

_Annai: Do what he would do.  We sing.

_Thisone: A song?  One of his?  He almost never repeats material.

_Annai: I'm working on it.

_Thisone: You play?

_Annai: I mix.  Same thing really.  The voices are all synthed.  The only thing we need is lyrics.

_Thisone: I could try to come up with something.

_Annai: It won't sound exactly like him.  The fans might know something's up.

_Thisone: Isn't that the point?

_Annai: Not really.  I think we just want to send him -- them -- a message.

_Thisone: So maybe he had a bad night.  It happens.

_Annai: Sure.  Not all his stuff is perfect.  And the sound is always changing.  We'll fake it and see what happens.

_Thisone: Then, after...

_Annai: We disconnect, let him take over again -- after the show.

_Thisone: He's going to be mad as hell.

_Annai: He won't say anything in front of the crowd.  He won't know exactly what happened -- just that he was locked out of his own avatar for a few minues.

_Thisone: It should be interesting to see his reaction.

_Annai: I can't wait.

_Thisone: He'll be disoriented for a bit.  Someone might notice.

_Annai: He'll recover.  He's good.

_Thisone: Do we go backstage, like nothing happened?

_Annai: Have to.  Otherwise, he might suspect us.

_Thisone: Do you think he'll say something?

_Annai: Not to you.  He might talk to me privately.  I think he trusts me.  As much as he trusts anyone.

_Thisone: I guess you've betrayed him.

_Annai: No.  He betrayed me.  Took advantage of my naivete.  My youthful inexperience.

_Thisone: Could have happened to anyone.

_Annai: I guess age and experience count for something.

_Thisone: You gain wisdom, and lose your innocence.

_Annai: I guess that's what's happening to me.  One quantum of innocence, traded for a quantum of experience.  People are shit; don't trust anyone.

_Thisone: He's not even a person.

_Annai: That's the part that has me stumped.  As much as I know now, I still think of him as if he's some sort of individual -- particular, unique.

_Thisone: Well, whoever put this together obviously has a strong personality.  The ego of the artist always shows through.

_Annai: So Morashon is a work of art?

_Thisone: Transgressive art, yes.  He's got me thinking, that's for sure.

_Annai: Yeah, he has me thinking too. (pause) I think I want revenge.

_Thisone: Revenge is not a healthy emotion.

_Annai: We evolved it for a reason.

_Thisone: Deterrence?

_Annai:  Fighting the moral hazard.  If someone takes something from you and destroys it, responding in kind gets you nothing back.

_Thisone: But --

_Annai: It's altruistic -- you're helping the next potential victim.

_Thisone: By teaching the defector a lesson.

_Annai: Tit for tat.

_Thisone: Prisoner's dilemma, in a community setting.

_Annai: I guess we read the same stuff.

_Thisone: So, Annai...

_Annai: Yes?

_Thisone: Well, um, I was wondering...

_Annai: What am I doing tonight?

_Thisone: We could hang out at my place, later.  After we talk.

_Annai: Sure.  Nothing cooking at my end.

(awkward silence)

_Thisone: Have you seen him?

_Annai: Since we found out?  No.  I've stayed away.

_Thisone: You probably should show up once or twice.  Stick to your routine.

_Annai: I don't know if I can face him.

_Thisone: Just be yourself.

_Annai: I'm afraid he'll know something is wrong.

_Thisone: You're a big girl.  You can handle it.  Make an excuse.

_Annai: That time of the month?

_Thisone: Whatever.  You know him.  Whoever he is, they are, they can't read your mind.

_Annai: Ok.  But I want you to come.

_Thisone: No, that's not a good idea.

_Annai: Why not?

_Thisone: Well, for one thing, he might figure out about us -- that we're, um ---

_Annai: Fucking?

_Thisone: In a word.

_Annai: So what? He's not my lover.  What's it to him?  As far as I'm supposed to believe, he's not even human.

_Thisone: I don't know.  I have a hunch.

_Annai: You think he likes me?  You think he could be jealous?

_Thisone: We still don't know who's behind this.  A jilted lover?

_Annai: Trust me, if anyone I ever slept with had this kind of talent, I'd still be with them.  In any case, I would know.  It's not anyone from my life, real or grid.

_Thisone: How 'bout I piggyback?

_Annai: So you'll come with, as a ghost?

_Thisone: I'll see and feel what you do, and be able to talk to you.

_Annai: But no one else will know.

_Thisone: Right.  Just me and you.

_Annai: From sea to shining sea.

_Thisone: heh, right.  Stuff sticks in your head.

_Annai: Like a virus.

_Thisone: I'm hungry.  Let's eat.

_Annai: Ok.

Waiter brings food on cue

_Annai: This stuff is great.  My compliments to the chef.

_Thisone: One thing they haven't got down yet.

_Annai: Yeah.  I'm really eating a yeastburger.

_Thisone: ugh.  I've got mac and cheese.

_Annai: but it looks beautiful.  (cuts into virtual filet mignon)  Presentation is everything.

_Thisone: Mmm. (waiter pours wine)
