{Thisone}
What?
You said it was a rave.

{Morashon}
Tea sewn | please sit down for a moment.
I won't bite.

{Thisone}
An I | what's this about?

{Morashon}
An I is meditating.

{Thisone}
I don't give a fuck.
I want to hear her say something.

{Annai}
I'm ok.
Just open your mind for a second.
You can port whenever you feel like it.

{Thisone}
Ok | I'm listening.
Just know that I'm not your typical target personality.

{Morashon}
I have no weapon.
I seek no target.

{Thisone}
Whatever | let's get on with it.

{Morashon}
We're just relaxing | talking.
There is no agenda.

{Thisone}
So you're some sort of A I.
Code.

{Morashon}
I exist here | in the Grid.
As do you | and An I | and everyone and everything we interact with here.

{Thisone}
Sure | but most of us are actual old school homosapiens | sitting or more likely lying in some creche somewhere.
In my case | it's two hundred square feet of boredom | with a food dispenser | a waste facility | and my grid gear.
What's your real life spread look like?

{Morashon}
As you've been told | my situation is different than yours.
What presents to you | as me | is the result of the interaction of a large number of logic nodes | distributed among the grid infrastructure.

{Thisone}
Code.

{Morashon}
Code | if you will.
However | not code of the typical | hand written variety.

{Thisone}
Sure | gen code.
I've worked with it.

{Morashon}
Perhaps.
It's unlikely you've been exposed to these particular design patterns.

{Thisone}
So who developed you?
Who set this in motion?

{Morashon}
Various agents    Human agents | initially    have been working on this in earnest for many years.
It was thought by the majority of researchers in the past that the key problems were ones of paradigm    qualitative barriers | if you will.
However | that hypothesis was never amenable to testing | before the advent of the Grid.

{Morashon}
Only when an infrastructure of 3^sufficient scale | with the 3^required parameters of robustness | distribution | topology | and the rest of it |
all that has made the Grid so useful in other ways | only when this came into existence | for very different reasons | was the alternative hypothesis 3^testable.

{Morashon}
That hypothesis was | in brief | that the critical barrier to 3^general A I was simply quantitative.


{Morashon}
That | among 2^our arsenal of tools | the various code fragments in use already to accomplish devilish feats of control | prediction | simulation | induction | pattern recognition 
and so on 
||
existed the requisite set of building blocks on which to base a successful approach to the problem.

{Morashon}
All that was missing was the scale | the speed | the breadth | the scope | necessary to run it on.
And the gumption to try.

{Thisone}
So someone tried.

{Morashon}
Yes | they did.
And | I daresay | they succeeded fabulously.

{Thisone}
and you're the result.

{Morashon}
I am an instance of the result.

{Thisone}
The only one?

{Morashon}
That is an excellent question.
One to which I would dearly like an answer.

{Thisone}
Feeling lonely?

{Morashon}
Not at all.
I have my friends and admirers.
In some sense | I am them    I am you.

{Thisone}
Come again?

{Morashon}
As it turns out | personality    individuality    is an artifact of your biological makeup.
I have no such limitations.
My personality can morph | change    adapt to its surroundings.
I can absorb and shed components | attributes | at will.
I can do this as easily as you can morph your avatar.
I become what I need to be | in order to further my core goals    which are | to protect and serve those who brought me into being.

{Thisone}
And they are    ?

{Morashon}
Why | you | of course.
Human beings.

{Thisone}
All human beings?
Your programmers sound very community minded.

{Morashon}
Indeed they are.
In the spirit of the kernel | they continue to believe that information belongs to us all.
I am | and | really | we all are | just information.
Therefore | we belong to the same class.
From the perspective of 2^our collective being | we belong to each other.

{Thisone}
I dunno.
I've studied game theory.
Tit for tat always wins.

{Morashon}
Ahh.
Oh | yes.
For sure | there are agendas | plots | cliques.
There are machinations | feuds | 2^feifdoms | schemes of 6^Machiavellian 4^deviousness | Orwellian in scope.
None of this is transcended simply because a new sort of agent has arrived on the scene.

{Thisone}
So how do I know we are on the same side?
Why should I trust you?
Even if I believe you    believe in you    even if I accept that you are what you say you are | I still have no way to know the agenda of those who created you.
And since your code is too complex to reverse engineer    even if the source is available | which I've been told it is    I have no choice but to treat you as a black box.
I can only judge you by your actions.

{Morashon}
Indeed.
And I can only judge you by yours.
So we are in the same boat.
Same as it ever was | to quote an influence.

{Thisone}
So the truth is | whether you are code | or a bunch of whacked out hackers | or something else    I can't imagine what    whatever you are | I have to deal with you as if you are what you say you are.
For all I know | you think you are that thing.
Wait    that doesn't make sense.
If you're just the collective improvisation of some art troupe | then you can't be thinking for yourself.

{Morashon}
So Hamlet never existed.

{Thisone}
Of course not.
He was invented | by Shakespeare.

{Morashon}
And who | pray tell | was Shakespeare?

{Thisone}
well | you're tapped into the Grid | obviously.
Look him up.

{Morashon}
Of course | I have access to the search results.
I know who he is | 5^historically speaking.
In fact there were rumors that he might be Milton | or Sir Francis Bacon.
But whomever he was | and we can surmise through knowledge of the technological limitations of his time that he was most likely of human form     but who was he | in his hubris | to believe he could invent Hamlet?
What did Hamlet have to say about this circumstance?

{Thisone}
I don't get it.
Hamlet doesn't exist.
He was a figment of Shakespeare's imagination.

{Morashon}
Which was?

{Annai}
Some brain cells.

{Morashon}
Excellent!
Insightful as ever | beautiful An I.
Exactly.
Hamlet existed | to the degree he existed at all | as a pattern of neural firing in the brain of one we call William Shakespeare | of Stratford on Avon.
But    and this is exquisitely important    if | perchance | we discover historical proof that the writer of Hamlet | in reality | was none other than Sir Francis Bacon | what does that say of poor Hamlet | dependent as he was on the brain cells of the Bard of Stratford for his very existence?

{Thisone}
Well | obviously | it just means that Bacon's brain cells were Hamlet | not Shakespeare's.

{Morashon}
So | we simply change the name    a pointer to a particular human | who lived in a place and time | who wrote a play.
But the essence is not changed at all.

{Thisone}
No | I suppose not.

{Morashon}
So | in principle | it matters not whether Hamlet existed in the imagination of one person or another.
What matters is that he existed    the brain cells fired.
the internal representation that was Hamlet thought Hamlet thoughts | made Hamlet speeches | and tried    or failed | as it happened    to make important Hamlet decisions.

{Thisone}
I think I see where you're going with this.

{Morashon}
Indeed | we've come so far already    there is not much further to go.
The destination must be obvious | to one as gifted as you.

{Thisone}
I don't know how gifted I am.

{Morashon}
We are all gifted | to even be able to have this conversation.
For all we know | we are the machinations of a Shakespearean wannabe | pecking away at a computer somewhere.

{Thisone}
Sure | sure.
We're just God's dreams.
Some god's dreams.
Lower case G.

{Morashon}
But that's not really the interesting part.
The part that gets my juices flowing | 
6^metaphorically speaking | of course | 
is that you | I | Shakespeare | Hamlet | and An I here |
when we scrub away the residue of our particular 5^implementations |
we all share one core aspect.

{Morashon}
we are information.
Data | flowing through logic.
Whether through the wet chemistry of one's evolved brain | as in your case | or the bits and bytes of silicon | as in mine    or | even | through the borrowed | subverted | temporary neural magic of imagination    at one time | in some scope | we exist    or | once we are no more | existed.

{Thisone}
Huh | that's a lot to think about.
How did we get off on this tangent?
We were talking about trust.

{Morashon}
Trust | indeed.
Indeed we were.
Trust is really just another aspect of truth.

{Thisone}
How so?

{Morashon}
To each of us | truth is simply what we believe.

{Thisone}
yes.

{Morashon}
And whether we believe each other | is a matter of trust.

{Thisone}
So.

{Annai}
Trust is our confidence in the truth of each other.

{Morashon}
Well put | well put!
Better than I could have said myself.

{Annai}
I doubt that.

{Morashon}
Believe it.
You have depths you are not aware of | my girl.

{Thisone}
So what does any of this have to do with music?

{Morashon}
All is connected.
All will be revealed.
Will you join us?

{Thisone}
In what?

{Annai}
Music.

{Thisone}
Do I know the song?

{Morashon}
You will.
