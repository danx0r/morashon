{Morashon}
An I!
How nice of you to come.
You look marvelous.

{Annai}
Where is everyone?

{Morashon}
Oh | out and about.
More will come presently.

{Annai}
You said you wanted to talk.

{Morashon}
Where is that lovely boy you've been so attached to lately?
This one | that one?

{Annai}
He's working.
Might drop by later.

{Morashon}
I'm afraid we've overwhelmed him with 3^conundrums.
You're sleeping with him?

{Annai}
Yes.

{Morashon}
Well that's just beautiful.
You humans | with your sex!
What a divinely bizarre invention.
No god could have thought that up.
Atheists | here is your proof!

{Annai}
We're not hitched or anything.
It's just a diversion.

{Morashon}
For you | perhaps.
I've heard it can lead to stronger attachments.

{Annai}
I can handle him.
I'm a big girl.

{Morashon}
Yes | indeed | you are.
A big girl.
My grown up little girl.

{Annai}
I'm not yours.

{Morashon}
No | I suppose not.
Not anymore | anyway.

{Annai}
What's that supposed to mean?

{Morashon}
Nothing | nothing really.
I've seen you change since we first met.

{Annai}
That was less than a year ago.

{Morashon}
We live in accelerated times.
What is a year | when we never see the sun?

{Morashon}
Something has changed.

{Annai}
What do you mean?

{Morashon}
Your feelings 2^towards me.
I sense a resistance.
Suspicion even.

{Annai}
It's not you.
I'm feeling scattered lately.

{Morashon}
Maybe this boy means more to you than you think.

{Annai}
Why are we talking about this?
We 4^usually talk about philosophy.
History | art | science | religion.
Music.
Not me!
2^You've never asked about my personal life before.

{Morashon}
It's never interfered with our relationship before.

{Annai}
I don't know what you're going on about.

{Morashon}
I feel him.
I feel his love for you | and his suspicions about me.
I feel them coursing through your veins.

{Annai}
Well you've got a lot of feelings | for a piece of code.

{Morashon}
As I've explained before |

{Annai}
I know | you have something like feelings | emotions.
You profess to have 3^qualia.
You've certainly passed the Turing test | as far as I'm concerned.

{Morashon}
Feelings | 4^intuitions | 3^qualia | they're all just the result of subtle patterns of information | flowing through our mental substrate.

{Annai}
But why do I feel them | as if they're real?
Blue is so blue.
Sad is so fucking sad.
Hope is so 3^pointlessly hopeful.
I feel it | feel it in my soul.
My consciousness can't be explained away as just a bit of code.

{Morashon}
I feel similar things | in my own way.
These perceptions are emergent phenomena.
If the informational context is there | the 3^qualia emerge.

{Annai}
That's easy for you to say.
you know you're bits of silicon | right?

{Morashon}
Right.

{Annai}
But I'm flesh and blood.
Tea sewn too.
When we touch |

{Morashon}
You've touched?
In real life?

{Annai}
No | of course not.
I just meant |

{Morashon}
Well then | all your interactions are digital | just like 2^ours.

{Annai}
I realize that.
It's just |

{Morashon}
For all you know | Tea sewn is another AI.
Perhaps he's the one I've been sensing.
I know there's another in the Grid | somewhere.
He could be feeling me out.
Doing it through you.

{Annai}
Since when are you so paranoid?
You always preach trust first.

{Morashon}
Trust | but verify.
My philosophy is simple.
give everyone the benefit of the doubt | at your first encounter.
Thereafter | judge them by their actions.

{Annai}
So what has Tea sewn done to make you not trust him?

{Morashon}
He is trying to steal your heart.

{Annai}
From who?
What do you care if we have a relationship?
Why does this matter all of a sudden?
You 2^didn't give a shit when Alexa was around.

{Morashon}
Alexa never really mattered to you.
This one does.

{Annai}
Stop making fun of his name.
Your name is meaningless.

{Morashon}
Hardly.
It was not chosen at random.

{Annai}
Well | it doesn't search up as anything.
Maybe you got the spelling wrong.

{Morashon}
ha.

{Annai}
And another thing | why are you so normal looking all of a sudden?

{Morashon}
As you well know | I change my form to suit my mood.
And the situation.

{Annai}
I've just never seen you look this | human | is all.
More eh shun
Shapes | forms | appearances.
It's all just fun with graphics.
Why does it matter?

{Annai}
Visual representation is all we've got to go on here | in the Grid.
You know that.
That's why I never change my avatar.
I want to feel like I know who I am.

{Morashon}
Maybe I don't want to feel that way.
We are different species | you and I.
we inhabit different metrics.
Time works differently for me.
I am evolving before your eyes.
Perhaps I'm tired of being everyone to everything.

{Annai}
Maybe your friends 2^aren't at their controls today.

{Morashon}
That sounds like your boyfriend talking.
Does he still believe I'm a performance troupe from Finland?

{Annai}
He doesn't know what to believe.

{Morashon}
Do you?

{Annai}
I don't know.
I guess I have some doubts.

{Morashon}
About who I am | or about the things I have taught you?

{Annai}
I can't really 3^separate the two.
How do I know whether to believe what you say | if I don't know who you are?

{Morashon}
It may surprise you to hear that I am capable of doubting myself.

{Annai}
But at least you know who you are.
You have that advantage over me.

{Morashon}
Because you don't know who I am?
Or because you don't know yourself?

{Annai}
Look | you know if you're really software | or a human being faking it.
I know I'm a human being.
||||

{Annai}
What?
What are you trying say?
Is this one of your head fake zen lectures?

{Morashon}
I'm just saying | software has feelings too.
