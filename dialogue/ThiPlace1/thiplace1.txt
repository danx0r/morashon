{Thisone}
You came.

{Annai}
Here I am.

{Thisone}
So you thought about what I said?

{Annai}
I thought about it.

{Thisone}
Will you help me?

{Annai}
Ok | I'll help.
I don't think 2^we'll find anything | but as he says | he's got nothing to hide.

{Thisone}
Right.
We'll see.

{Annai}
So are you reviewing his code?

{Thisone}
We're talking pet a L O seas.
Over a 4^quadrillion lines of code equivalent.
Practically all of it 6^algorithmically generated.

{Annai}
So what's the line of attack?
I just reviewed his kernel | the part that started it off.
Lots of tricky corner cases | but the core ideas are manageable.

{Thisone}
Yeah | I checked that part out.
But keep in mind | that just bootstraps the process.
Each 4^iteration generates orders of magnitude more code | which then generates more code | and so on.

{Annai}
Right | that's the only way you could get a logic base that huge.

{Thisone}
Of course.
And it's massively parallel.
He must be using a noticeable portion of our local grid co ords.
I'd be surprised if the authorities didn't know about him.

{Annai}
I'm sure they do.
I guess they're all for it.

{Thisone}
Maybe.
3^Actually | he seems to mask a significant percentage from inspection.
There are a few core libs that don't register themselves in the normal way.

{Annai}
Really?
I 2^didn't notice that.
Let me see.

{Annai}
That's really weird.
I've never seen a mask like that before.
It's kind of amateurish.

{Thisone}
Almost as if he's trying a bit too hard to look suspicious.

{Annai}
Exactly.
Miss direction?

{Thisone}
Lull you into a false sense of superiority?
So the real mask is somewhere else.

{Annai}
Pull up the kernel again.
Screens close | new ones open.
Perspectives shift and warp.

{Annai}
Wait | check this out.
Does that ring a bell?

{Thisone}
Ack | that's grid kernel code from maybe fifteen years ago.
How did you even know to look for it?
It's before your time.

{Annai}
I'm a student of 3^history.
I've disassembled the kernel back ten major revs.

{Thisone}
You're quite the hacker | for

{Annai}
A girl?

{Thisone}
I was going to say | for someone so young.
I associate youth with talent | energy | and inexperience.

{Annai}
I've been coding since before I could talk.

{Thisone}
Typical.
Still.

{Annai}
Anyway | check this out.
I diffed it against the original.

{Thisone}
Why would he start with some old cruft like this?
It's completely obsolete.

{Annai}
Yes | but the security mods have this stuff white listed.
Maybe | if you just change an op here or there | you can get something by them?

{Thisone}
Maybe | but not easily.
You could only change a few ops at a time.
They do random testing.
too slow to brute force every op every cycle.
So you might pass 5^occasionally | but you'd still fail some percentage of the time.

{Annai}
It gets trickier.
The diffs all look like patches from one old version to another.

{Thisone}
Even better.
If security flags anything as suspicious | it checks the patch logs and sees that it matches.

{Annai}
Right.
But by cleverly choosing a specific sequence of patches | 
he 5^eventually generates code that passes security | 
but with a few custom ops.

{Thisone}
that's pretty clever.
And wholly illegal.

{Annai}
What's it for?
What's the code 4^actually do?

{Thisone}
We can't figure that out from the source.
It's too fluid.
We'd have to put a monitor in there.

{Annai}
Hold on.
I said I'd help you analyze.
That's outright 3^hackery.

{Thisone}
Look | you've seen that there's something fishy.
Above board open source doesn't have wicked masking code like this.

{Annai}
Well | no.
It wouldn't | 4^usually.

{Thisone}
So we know there's something else going on.
All I'm suggesting is | we find out what it is.
It's open source anyway | we have as much right to hack on it as anyone else.

{Annai}
Oh | right.
So you're going to check your changes in and add a log entry?

{Thisone}
well | not yet.
I want to see what's going on first.
I could claim that I'm just researching some 2^dodgy patches.
Checking for security holes | that sort of thing.

{Annai}
Hah.
Let's see who believes it.

{Thisone}
Well | if it comes to that | More eh shun | or his dev team | whoever he really is | they'll have some explaining to do themselves.

{Annai}
Tit for tat?

{Thisone}
Exactly.
What's good for the goose.

{Annai}
I suppose.
This is just the sort of thinking More eh shun hates.

{Thisone}
How convenient.
Espouse a philosophy of trust.
Do as I say | not as I do.

{Annai}
I guess I'm in | for now.
I | I trusted him.
I never expected something like this.

{Thisone}
Maybe there's an innocent explanation.
They may be protecting some proprietary IP through obfuscation.
There's some case law about that | if it's hard enough to decipher | you can claim trade secret.

{Annai}
Him.
Maybe.
But he's not what he says he is.
A lie is a lie.

{Thisone}
Well | the other scenarios are even darker.

{Annai}
L Ron?

{Thisone}
Something like that.

{Annai}
So when I listen to his music | and it moves me | makes me feel like he understands me | what's in my soul | is that real?

{Thisone}
I don't know.
I guess if it means something to you | it means something.
His motivations could be complex.
He may contradict himself morally | but still be a great artist.
I keep calling him he || but it's probably them.
I don't know anymore.
I'm out of my depth.

{Annai}
".
I contradict myself.
I am large.
I contain multitudes.

{Thisone}
Walt Whitman?

{Annai}
Twentieth century poet.

{Thisone}
Oh.
Not bad.

{Annai}
I'll do it.

{Thisone}
The monitor?
I thought I |

{Annai}
Let me do it.
I know him better.
I'll be able to mask it.

{Thisone}
Umm | ok.
Let me review it before you take it live.

{Annai}
Sure.
I'll ping you when it's done.
An I ports away.

{Thisone}
Oh | ok.
Nice seeing you.
Bub bye for now.
