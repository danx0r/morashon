{Thisone}
3;You 88%6;came.

{Annai}
2.5;Here I 5;am.

{Thisone}
5;So | 3;you thought about 122%what I 99%6;said?

{Annai}
118%6;I 3;thought about it.

{Thisone}
77%6;So.
|
117%3;Will you 4;help 88%5.5;me?

{Annai}
88%5;O 3;k.
5;I'll 4;help.
132%3;I don't think 2^we'll 5;find 2;anything | 121%3.5;but as he says | he's got nothing to 82%5.5_-4;hide.

{Thisone}
5.5_-4;Right.
5.5;We'll 83%3.5;see.

{Annai}
78%7_0;So | 100%3;are you 122%reviewing his 92%5.5_4.5;code?

{Thisone}
112%3.5;We're talking 101%5;pet 3;a 88%L O 5.5_-2;seas.
110%3;Over a 3^3,5,3;quadrillion lines of code 122%3,4,3,2;equivalent.
128%3;Practically 101%5;awl 3;of it 6^152%algorithmically 99%5,2;generated.

{Annai;speed=1.2}
80%So | 100%what's the line of 3,5.5;attack?
109%I just reviewed his 100%5,3;kernel | the part 2.5;that starts it 5.5_-4.5;off.
Lots of tricky 130%100%5,3;corner cases | but the core ideas are 5,2;manageable.

{Thisone;speed=1.14;pitch=0.3}
75%6_-4;Yes | 114%3;I checked that part 5;out.
But keep in 4_-5;mind | 106%3;that just bootstraps the 5,2;process.
98%Each 4^iteration generates orders of 4,2.5;magnitude more 3.5;code | 2.5;which then generates 5;more 3;code | and so 1;on.

{Annai;speed=1.14}
5_-5;Right.
110%3.2;that's the only way you could get a 101%4.5,2.6;logic base that 88%6_-6;huge.

{Thisone;speed=1.15}
80%2;Of 5_2;course.
3;And it's massively 5,2;parallel.
He 3.5;must be using a 3^5,3.5;noticeable portion of our 1^3;local 5;grid 2.5;co 1^ords.
3;I'd 3;be 3,5;surprised 4;if the 3;authorities didn't 5;know 2;about him.

{Annai}
105%I'm 4.5;sure 84%2.7;they 5.5;do.
110%3;I guess they're all 5;for 2.5;it.

{Thisone;speed=1.1}
82%75%5,2_5;Maybe.
3^5,3;Actually | 3.5;he seems 142%to 120%mask 100%a 3,5,3;significant percentage from 3,5,2;inspection.
122%3;There are a 100%5.5;few 3;core libs 3.22;that don't 5,3;register themselves in 3;the 1^normal 80%6_-4;way.

{Annai;speed=1.1}
62%92%3.2,5_3;Really?
3.5;I 2^didn't 5.5,2.5;notice that.
3.5;Let me 77%8_-3;see.

{Annai;speed=1.1}
5;That's 3;really 80%5;weird.
3.5;I've never seen a 5;mask 119%2.667;like 4;that 105%3.4,2_0;before.
107%It's kind of 5,2.4;amateurish.

{Thisone;speed=1.1}
110%Almost as if he's 4,3;trying a 90%5;bit too 100%5_0;hard 117%3;to look 100%3,5,2;suspicious.

{Annai;speed=1.15}
3,5,2;Exactly.
3;Miss 3,4,6_4;direction?

{Thisone}
Lull you into a false sense of superiority?
So the real mask is somewhere else.

{Annai}
Pull up the kernel again.
Screens close | new ones open.
Perspectives shift and warp.

{Annai}
Wait | check this out.
Does that ring a bell?

{Thisone}
Ack | that's grid kernel code from maybe fifteen years ago.
How did you even know to look for it?
It's before your time.

{Annai}
I'm a student of 3^history.
I've disassembled the kernel back ten major revs.

{Thisone}
You're quite the hacker | for

{Annai}
A girl?

{Thisone}
I was going to say | for someone so young.
I associate youth with talent | energy | and inexperience.

{Annai}
I've been coding since before I could talk.

{Thisone}
Typical.
Still.

{Annai}
Anyway | check this out.
I diffed it against the original.

{Thisone}
Why would he start with some old cruft like this?
It's completely obsolete.

{Annai}
Yes | but the security mods have this stuff white listed.
Maybe | if you just change an op here or there | you can get something by them?

{Thisone}
Maybe | but not easily.
You could only change a few ops at a time.
They do random testing.
too slow to brute force every op every cycle.
So you might pass 5^occasionally | but you'd still fail some percentage of the time.

{Annai}
It gets trickier.
The diffs all look like patches from one old version to another.

{Thisone}
Even better.
If security flags anything as suspicious | it checks the patch logs and sees that it matches.

{Annai}
Right.
But by cleverly choosing a specific sequence of patches | 
he 5^eventually generates code that passes security | 
but with a few custom ops.

{Thisone}
that's pretty clever.
And wholly illegal.

{Annai}
What's it for?
What's the code 4^actually do?

{Thisone}
We can't figure that out from the source.
It's too fluid.
We'd have to put a monitor in there.

{Annai}
Hold on.
I said I'd help you analyze.
That's outright 3^hackery.

{Thisone}
Look | you've seen that there's something fishy.
Above board open source doesn't have wicked masking code like this.

{Annai}
Well | no.
It wouldn't | 4^usually.

{Thisone}
So we know there's something else going on.
All I'm suggesting is | we find out what it is.
It's open source anyway | we have as much right to hack on it as anyone else.

{Annai}
Oh | right.
So you're going to check your changes in and add a log entry?

{Thisone}
well | not yet.
I want to see what's going on first.
I could claim that I'm just researching some 2^dodgy patches.
Checking for security holes | that sort of thing.

{Annai}
Hah.
Let's see who believes it.

{Thisone}
Well | if it comes to that | More eh shun | or his dev team | whoever he really is | they'll have some explaining to do themselves.

{Annai}
Tit for tat?

{Thisone}
Exactly.
What's good for the goose.

{Annai}
I suppose.
This is just the sort of thinking More eh shun hates.

{Thisone}
How convenient.
Espouse a philosophy of trust.
Do as I say | not as I do.

{Annai}
I guess I'm in | for now.
I | I trusted him.
I never expected something like this.

{Thisone}
Maybe there's an innocent explanation.
They may be protecting some proprietary IP through obfuscation.
There's some case law about that | if it's hard enough to decipher | you can claim trade secret.

{Annai}
Him.
Maybe.
But he's not what he says he is.
A lie is a lie.

{Thisone}
Well | the other scenarios are even darker.

{Annai}
L Ron?

{Thisone}
Something like that.

{Annai}
So when I listen to his music | and it moves me | makes me feel like he understands me | what's in my soul | is that real?

{Thisone}
I don't know.
I guess if it means something to you | it means something.
His motivations could be complex.
He may contradict himself morally | but still be a great artist.
I keep calling him he || but it's probably them.
I don't know anymore.
I'm out of my depth.

{Annai}
".
I contradict myself.
I am large.
I contain multitudes.

{Thisone}
Walt Whitman?

{Annai}
Twentieth century poet.

{Thisone}
Oh.
Not bad.

{Annai}
I'll do it.

{Thisone}
The monitor?
I thought I |

{Annai}
Let me do it.
I know him better.
I'll be able to mask it.

{Thisone}
Umm | ok.
Let me review it before you take it live.

{Annai}
Sure.
I'll ping you when it's done.
An I ports away.

{Thisone}
Oh | ok.
Nice seeing you.
Bub bye for now.
