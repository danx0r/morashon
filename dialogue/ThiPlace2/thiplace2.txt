{Thisone}
Hi.
You look alot like your av.

{Annai}
Very funny.
I think I found something.

{Thisone}
I thought you were working on the monitor code.

{Annai}
I did.
I let it run all night.

{Thisone}
Him.
I thought we said we'd review it |

{Annai}
Sorry.
It looked solid | so I let it fly.
Guess what?

{Thisone}
M him?

{Annai}
You were right.
It's not AI.
It's an interface.

{Thisone}
so some hackers |

{Annai}
somebody | somewhere | runs it.
Not Finland | as far as I know.

{Thisone}
I assume it's masked |

{Annai}
Yep | serious wicked firewall.
Impossible to tell who's controlling it.
But |

{Thisone}
We could intercept.

{Annai}
Yes.
Now that we know what's going on | we could | take over.
Be More eh shun.

{Thisone}
but the interface gear | all the heads and limbs and stuff.
Multiple conversations?

{Annai}
That's the interesting part.
It's not real AI | but there is some tasty interface code.
It seems like it probably uses available stuff.
Advanced | expensive | but not something totally new.

{Thisone}
So we could insert 3^ourselves | man in the middle.

{Annai}
We can take over the interface | and play More eh shun for a while.
Anonymously | using the same firewall they use.

{Thisone}
but with our own hashes.

{Annai}
So they can't find us | same as we can't find them.

{Thisone}
And they won't report us | start an investigation.

{Annai}
That would be suicide.
The investigation will lead to them as the primary source.

{Thisone}
I dunno | this sounds a bit dangerous.
We don't know who these people are.

{Annai}
This is the only way to find out.
Use their own code to send a message.

{Thisone}
What about the music?

{Annai}
There's a huge database of stuff they must be cribbing from.
Obscure releases that were never popular.
Then they run algorithms to extrapolate new tunes from a style mix.
But you would need real talent to make it into anything.

{Thisone}
So they have an artist.

{Annai}
At least one.
I have to believe that.
This isn't your run of the mill bunch of hackers.

{Thisone}
more like an 3^anarcho performance troupe with hacker skills.

{Annai}
If you say so.
But I want to know who he | she | they | really are.
I feel betrayed.

{Thisone}
Because he lied to you?

{Annai}
Because he preaches about trust | 
transparency | 5^cooperation versus defection.
And he's hiding something.
He.
That's rich.

{Thisone}
I still don't know if you're a she.

{Annai}
You know I am.

{Thisone}
I think so.

{Annai}
Well I am | if it matters so much.
And by the way | I know you're a dude.

{Thisone}
How can you be so sure?

{Annai}
You're a mega dude.
Mega nerdy dude.

{Thisone}
Thanks for the compliment.

{Annai}
No | it's ok.
I like it.

{Thisone}
Um | ah.
I guess we never traded pics.

{Annai}
I just look like this.

{Thisone}
That's what they all say.

{Annai}
No | really.
I even have all the clothes.

{Thisone}
Well still.

{Annai}
There you go again.
You know 2^we'll never meet in real life | unless we win the mega lot or something.

{Thisone}
No | I know | but.

{Annai}
So who cares what's real?
I could send you picks | 1^vids even | and how would you know they 2^weren't shopped up?

{Thisone}
I guess.

{Annai}
Anyway | why are we talking about this?
Are we flirting?
Is this a date or something?

{Thisone}
No | An I | I mean | well | I dunno.
I um | I don't know what to say.

{Annai}
Say what you feel.
Mean what you say.

{Thisone}
I've never been good at this.
I | since the breakdown | I've never.

{Annai}
That's a long time.
To be alone.

{Thisone}
Yeah.
Well | it just | never felt right.

{Annai}
I was eleven.

{Thisone}
so you never |

{Annai}
Never.
Off line | I mean.

{Thisone}
so online |

{Annai}
There were some guys.
At least I think they were guys.
And a girl.

{Thisone}
Maybe I am old.

{Annai}
It's just sex.
And 5^technologly.
Grid sex | you know.
It's a release.
Why be embarrassed?
It's no big deal.

{Thisone}
It just never felt real to me.
I tried a couple times.
It was so | awkward.

{Thisone}
Oh.
Hi there.

{Annai}
Do you have all the gear?

{Thisone}
You mean | um | you know | for sex?

{Annai}
That's what we were just talking about | right?
Or maybe I missed something.

{Thisone}
Yes | I have the gear.

{Annai}
We can be anyone we want.

{Thisone}
That's what makes it hard for me.
I think | if you had experienced.

{Annai}
Real sex?

{Thisone}
Ack | you're so | um | it's so easy for you to talk about this stuff.

{Annai}
It's just something we can do | you know.
Like music | or hacking.
It's just another part of life.

{Thisone}
No | I can't believe that.
I don't see it that way.
It's something different.
In real life |

{Annai}
There you go again.
Can't you get it into your head that real life is over?

{Thisone}
Not when it comes to this.
Something so | so personal.
It can't be the same.

{Annai}
It's not the same | I guess.
Some people say it's better.
I wouldn't know.

{Thisone}
I've always figured those were people who never did it right in the first place.
Never met the right one.

{Annai}
Did you meet the right one?

{Thisone}
There was someone | before.

{Annai}
Before all this.

{Thisone}
Right before.
We were only together for a few months.
Then.

{Annai}
Did she make it?

{Thisone}
She was across the universe.

{Annai}
Oh.
Separated.

{Thisone}
yeah.

{Annai}
And you couldn't afford to |

{Thisone}
Well | at first travel was restricted to government officials | remember.
They kept saying they would open it up to everyone | but | you know the rest.

{Annai}
5^Eventually they did | sort of.

{Thisone}
three years pay for a single trip | on a standard salary.
Even then | no guarantee you'd be allowed to resettle.

{Annai}
That sucks.

{Thisone}
We kept saying we'd save up.
A few years went by | but we never managed to get it together.

{Annai}
Sorry.

{Thisone}
It's ok.
I'm not sure she really wanted to.
She met someone local.
They had a large shelter | a few thousand.

{Annai}
wow.
That's | well | it sucks.

{Thisone}
So what about you?
Aren't there any boys where you live?

{Annai}
One or two.
Duds.
Completely boring.
Anyway | who said I only like boys?

{Thisone}
Well | or girls | whatever.
I mean men | women.

{Annai}
Don't worry | I'm of age.
Like I said | no one clicked.
It's the grid life for me.
An I touches Tea sewn's thigh.

{Annai}
Do you feel that?

{Thisone}
Yes | of course.
I told you | I'm geared.

{Annai}
Why do you gear | if you don't | if there's nobody?

{Thisone}
well | there's | I | um |

{Annai}
Bots?
You do bot sex | but not grid sex?

{Thisone}
Look | this is getting embarrassing.

{Annai}
That's so funny.
I'm sorry.
I 2^didn't mean to laugh.

{Thisone}
Ok | enough fun and games.

{Annai}
You're right.
Let's not get silly here.

{Thisone}
Well | maybe | I could | try again.
Someday.

{Annai}
Did I offer myself?
Am I that easy?

{Thisone}
I didn't mean that.

{Annai}
Well | I did.
Sort of.
Offer.

{Thisone}
So you don't care what I really look like?

{Annai}
I see you.
I feel you.
I know who you are.

{Thisone}
I could be fat | sick | older than I'm saying.
Just plain ugly.

{Annai}
Maybe.
But you would still be you.
And I like you.

{Thisone}
I | thanks.

{Annai}
Sure.
Anytime.
I mean | I don't mean | my moods change.
I'm not promising anything.
But I'll like you | until I don't.
And I hope I don't.
Stop liking you | I mean.
They move closer | and kiss gently on the lips.

{Annai}
Bye for now.
