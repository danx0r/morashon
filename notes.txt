notes while listening to reading 8/29/12:
    too many f-bombs?

    fix script to == reading (esp starlite verses)
    scenes?

    dialog over "changing time" should come in over the section right after last lyrics
    
    pg 9: start with intro-morashon, C - Cmin, into ambient? (or stick with Starlite for this scene? or transition somewhere in the middle)
    maybe starlite v3 should be here, not later

    r/l, other abbreviations (AFAICT) -- spell them out

    everything we interact with [here] -- weird

    insightful as ever (delete 'beautiful'? too condescending?? 'brilliant'?)

    mouth: to your lifestyle --> in your lifestyle
    check last chorus

    scene starting 'you came': add ambient

    DONE instrumental to Half In Love: premature? (nothing in that previous scene to set it up)
    DONE next scene: ambient! (fade it out during flirt section! leave HIL fade in)
    splice in "good bye" for "bye for now"?

    bring down ambient around "when the equipment comes"

    From sea to shining sea

    (create 'morashon' theme bgd music for Morashon scenes?)

    mr happy: "smile" at end of 1st chorus, harmony seems low/missing
    extend piano counterpoint?

    Transition from song to next scene (About time) could happen over end of MrHappy fade (earlier than now)

    what was that about? (should have been a pause)

    (end scene w/ Morashon: ambient on one side -- happens later; should be sooner?)

    "This where it all ends" -- starlite outro instead of v3 (hmm - wait, we use it later!)
    outro dx7 a bit obnoxious
 
    pause during kiss

    last scene: instead of outro, instrumental starlite?
    Over&over could fade in during lines like "I feel a song coming on"
    (I want you to be mine/In love we will/shall combine/I want you over and over - instead of "I want your love divine")

    replace traffic noise on God Is Blue

    upbeat song (You? LAIR?) after ballad fade out while credits roll
