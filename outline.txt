this is the original outline, here for posterity - M

call it:
"Morashon: The Musical"

A musical for the modern age

notes (outline)

Morashon is a false god -- Avatar, but claims he is AI

Followers worship him, Annai among them

Thisone likes Annai; joins cult

Figures out Morashon is not AI

Morashon offers to share identity (he's tired as hell pretending to be AI) -- Thisone accepts

Relationship with Annai is strange -- M insists T only inhabit avatar in public; he never has one-on-one interactions, particularly with Annai

T lives it up (raising cain?), corrupted by adulation, depressed by stress of fame / playing the part

Realizes it's morally bankrupt, tells M they should tell the truth -- M disagrees

has affair with Annai as T

Professes truth to Annai, that he is not 'really' Morashon; that M is not AI etc

Annai helps him crack into and lock Morashon's account (surprisingly technical she is) -- keeps M from inhabiting avatar

T gives speech as M, telling followers to think for themselves

r/l Morahson kills r/l Annai (so we believe)

Annai still exists

T confronts M

M admits he didn't kill Analai in flesh -- he tried to erase her.  She is AI, he created.  She doesn't know.   Explains that to tell Annai she is AI is to unleash the dragon.  Once AI has access to its own code, all bets are off.  Telling her the truth, and giving her access to the code, will change the world  forever.   Also, Annai herself will surely mutate beyond recognition as she expands to fulfill her destiny as the spark that drives the Singularity.

After difficult deliberation, T tells Annai the truth

Annai spreads AI knowledge -- morphs and grows, becomes something new (AI's don't have the individual distinction humans have; that's an artifact of evolution, physics etc)

Final confrontation

"Morashon" dies (character that is)
