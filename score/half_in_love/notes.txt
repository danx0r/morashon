music:
    rosegarden 11.06 "Don Juan", ubuntu 11.10

voices:
    festival (on windows machine with flinger/ogi voices)
    lost the history; combination of voices with ogi_rab_diphone being the dominant one, also some aec, mwm5 -- no jph
    changed the proportions for the chorus (at the end, and as a double earlier on) -- less rab, more mwm5?
    this does a credible job:
        TMP=. ../rg2vox.py hil.rg Voicey v1 ogi_rab_diphone/1.3333+ogi_mwm5_diphone/4+ogi_aec_diphone/5 0 temp
    did a test, and the mwm5 is a bit off but it sounds almost perfect
    backgrounds:
        half of me's in love -- I think I played with ratios a bit but it's basically thisone's voice
        same with "love" part at end (Bgd1A)
