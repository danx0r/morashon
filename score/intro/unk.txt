##run jack-control:
##> jack_control start

use qjackctl
for headphones/alt output: setup/interface (arrow to right pulls down menu)

note rosegarden runs some random jackd if you don't run jack manually

then double-click .rg file (rosegarden)
often main screen appears in wrong workspace (find it) -- you just see transport
if new machine: fiddle with jack setup for buffer stuff

to record:

after running jack + rosegarden, run timemachine -f wav
go to jack connect menu
highlight rosegarden on left, timemachine on right
right click and select "connect"
hit the big red button to record
note it seems to leave lots of dead time at top (recording always?)
use audacity to trim & export to mp3
