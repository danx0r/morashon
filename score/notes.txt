random notes on my complexified Linux midi/audio setup

Ubuntu 11.04 (10.x doesn't seem to have the same Rosegarden plugins)

score/fluidsynth has all the fluidsynth patches; for portability, they are referred to in the rosegarden files as /fluidsynth, so you
              need a symlink from /fluidsynth --> ./score/fluidsynth
